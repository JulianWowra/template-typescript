# Template for my TypeScript projects

This TypeScript template provides a good start for TypeScript projects. It already implements the following useful things to work out of the box:

- Standard [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) setup
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) with [typedoc-github-theme](https://github.com/JulianWowra/typedoc-github-theme)
- [GitHub Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows)
